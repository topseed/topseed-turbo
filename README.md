# SmoothPage

 SmoothPage loads pages, a single-page application implementation. 
 It uses jquery slim, fetch, loosely coupled and does not load the app shell DOM, only content.
 It requires jquery and js-Signals. In ie it requires fetch.
 When using w/ side bar, you need to handle it.

 This is a fork of SmoothState, SmoothState may be able to handle more corner cases.
