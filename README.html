<h1 id="smoothpage">SmoothPage</h1>
<p> SmoothPage loads pages, a single-page application implementation. 
 Based on SmoothState.js. It uses jquery slim, fetch, loosely coupled and does not load the app shell DOM, only content.
 It requires jquery and js-Signals. In ie it requiers fetch.
 When using w/ side bar, you need to handle it.</p>
<p> This is a fork of SmoothState, SmoothState may be able to handle more corner cases.</p>
